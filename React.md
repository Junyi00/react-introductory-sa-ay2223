## Why React

React is one of the modern frontend library that has grown popularity recently. Many developers has picked up this library for a multitude of reasons

1. Reusable components throughout your application

    React components is a powerful capability to take advantage of. 
    Each component are like independent pieces of code that has its own rendering logic.  
    This allows you to take advantage of abstraction, also simplifying development cycles.

2. High Performance through Virtual DOM

    A virtual representation of the UI is kept in memory through ReactDOM. By comparing previou states, it updates only the neccessary parts of the real DOM to minimise reads/writes, boosting performance compared to traditional web applications.

3. Many supporting libraries available

    Due to the popularity of React, many 3rd party libraries exists to achieves certain use cases easily.  
    While some may like this flexiblity, some may prefer frameworks that provides such capabilities out of the box.

    Here are just some examples,

    |Use Cases|Available Libraries |
    |-:|:-|
    |State Management | **Redux**, Recoil, Mobx |
    |Mobile Development | React Native |
    |Components / UI | Tailwind UI, React Bootstrap, **Blueprint** |
    |Forms | React Hook Form, Formik, React Final Form,

    _Bolded libraries are used in Source Academy_

4. Growing community as React gains popularity


## What is React

As mentioned, React is a frontend JavaScript library developed **building user interfaces** .

It is `declarative-based`, where you describe the final state of the UI you desire and React is responsible for determining the necessary changes to achieve that goal. [Read More](https://ui.dev/imperative-vs-declarative-programming)

It is `unopiniated` or flexible in a sense, it leaves the build and structure of the application to you. Every react project can look different in file structure or organisation, there is **no one right way**. 
Hence, we will be discussing what Source Academy's organisation is later onwards.
